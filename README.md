## Is Rust as good as they say?

I would call myself a fan of Rust in that I cheer it on from the sidelines. However, I have never built anything in Rust outside of school projects. With this project, I wanted to challenge myself to build something I would actually entirely in Rust.

I love the idea of Rust because of its safety and beautiful functional programming features, such as pattern matching and variant types (enums). However, I recall from school projects that actually using Rust can be quite a challenge to the uninitiated.

Although I hardly play poker, I find it intriguing just how good the best poker players are. I wonder how much of their success comes down to their ability to quickly calculate the odds in their head versus the ability to read and intimidate others. So, with this project, I will be building the simplest part of a good poker player: the odds calculator. And I will be doing this entirely in Rust to try to immerse myself in the language and see if the pleasant features make it worth the hype. While I understand that for a self-contained project like this, I will not be leveraging the safety features to their best ability, I hope that I will still be able to see the benefits when it comes to testing.
